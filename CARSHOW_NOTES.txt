TODO
----

- Enable WebSockets to enable push notification and bi-directional communication
   - This will enable the following
      - Send notifications to all the judges when Judging is open
      - Send everyone a notification when "special voting" is enabled
      - Can send individual users notifications too
   - This means you will be able to enable inapp chat
      - If we enable inapp chat then consider the following
         - Setup a server-side word filter, such as using "bad-words" or "leo-profanity" library.
            - THus if someone says "fuck", it will come up as "f***"
      - If someone is being an ass, then be able to block him from posting so that all he can do is read the posts but can not make any
      - Limit the number of characters someone can post so that someone can't copy/paste a novel into chat
