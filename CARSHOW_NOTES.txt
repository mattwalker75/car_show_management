TODO
----

- Enable WebSockets to enable push notification and bi-directional communication
   - This means you will be able to enable in app chat
      - If we enable inapp chat then consider the following
         - Setup a server-side word filter, such as using "bad-words" or "leo-profanity" library.
            - THus if someone says "fuck", it will come up as "f***"
      - If someone is being an ass, then be able to block him from posting so that all he can do is read the posts but can not make any
      - Limit the number of characters someone can post so that someone can't copy/paste a novel into chat


All the code is commited and posted to the repo, so if we need to back out changes, that is not going to be an issue
